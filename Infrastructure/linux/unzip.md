To extract a tar.gz file in Linux, you can use the tar command with the -xvzf options. This command extracts the archive ( -x), lists the files being extracted ( -v), uses gzip to decompress ( -z), and specifies the file name ( -f). For example, 
tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz 
would extract the file "archive.tar.gz" to the current directory.
